# Bonus Features and Ideas for Improvements

1. `Display total revenue/cost per driver`
  - this sum is displayed in each driver container at the bottom
    - revenue in green; cost in red

2. `Allow editing revenue/cost when order is assigned to a driver, so the totals become dynamic`
  - Clicking the pencil icon triggers a form inside a modal that enables editting any of these values for that order:
      - cost
      - revenue
      - driver
      - description
      - start time
      - end time
      - destination address
      - source address

3. `Clean and visually appealing UI; thought-through UX` 
  - Simple alerts and toasts to inform users
    - success alerts and error toasts
  - Simple animations to add user enjoyability 
    - drag and dropping orders between windows - custom built hooks from scratch
    - orders grow in animation for fun 
  - added scrollable windows in order forms for selecting a driver, source, and destination for orders

4. `More details about drivers and orders can be viewed and edited. You can think what other information we might be relevant to the system`
  - Added edittable supplier address information
  - Added edittable customer address information

5. `Orders have start and end times, and a driver canâ€™t have two orders that overlap in time`
  - Every order is checked for overlapping start and end times for the driver before create/update of orders in the database

6. `Ability to create new drivers and/or orders`
  - both are available by clicking the buttons: `Create a Driver` and `Create Order`
7. `Ability to delete drivers and/or orders`
  - Both are implented, triggered by: 
    - hovering over an order and clicking the delete-icon
    - hovering over the driver window and clicking the delete-icon at the bottom-right of the driver window


8. `Persist data either in a database of your choice (make sure the documentation is clear enough for us to run it)`
  - uses postgres and documentation is available in README.md for dev setup

9. `Or give us an ERD of your database model` 
   - screenshot of ERD can be found at `/docs/db-erd.png`

10. `Ability to download CSV data through the web interface`
  - uses react-csv library to download a csv file for all orders with column attributes:
    - order_id
    - driver_fname
    - driver_lname
    - order_description
    - source_address
    - source_address_city
    - source_address_country
    - source_address_postal
    - destination_address
    - destination_address_city
    - destination_address_country
    - destination_address_postal
    - start_time
    - end_time
    - revenue
    - cost

11. `Anything else you can think of!`    
  - Added supplier, customer, address entities
    - Enables relationship between supplier <> addresses and customer <> addresses 
    - improves data integrity and reduces redundancy
  - Ability to change order's source address and destination address
